## Component Classifications

| Component Type | Description | Examples / Notes |
|----------------|-------------|------------------|
| **Mount** | The base attachment structure that connects to the chassis (e.g., tubular or profile) | Tube mounts (25mm, 40mm), 2020, 4040 rail clamps |
| **Plate** | Flat interface between a mount and a shaker/transducer | BST2 Plate, TT25 Plate |
| **Bracket** | Angular or positional element that offsets or aligns mounts/plates | Right-angle offset bracket, sliding adjuster |
| **Fitting** | Adapter piece that mates mismatched geometries or fasteners | Threaded collar, tapered insert |
| **Housing** | Covers, ducts, or enclosures used to protect or route parts | Wire guards, fan housings |
| **Isolator** | Damping elements to control vibration transfer | TPU bushings, vibration spacers |
| **Cap / Cover** | Cosmetic or protective closure components | Dust caps, thread covers |

## Usage Guidance

- Each part in this repository should follow naming convention:  
  `Type_RigOrDevice_Compatibility_Version.stl`  
  Example: `Mount_Tube40_BST2_V5.stl`
  
- Group components into folders matching this structure:
